<h3 class="topics_title">Compact Objects</h3>
<p class="paragraph_text">
  Compact objects refer to astronomical objects that are called "compact"
  because they are much smaller in size compared to their mass, and their
  density is much higher than normal matter.
  <br />
  <br />
  These object compacts such as neutron stars, quarks stars and black holes are
  created through the process of stellar evolution, specifically the collapse of
  the core of a massive star.
  <br />
  <br />
  When a massive star runs out of fuel, it undergoes a series of gravitational
  collapses that can lead to the formation of a compact object. The exact
  process depends on the mass of the star.

<h3 class="topics_title">Black Hole</h3>
<p class="paragraph_text">
  Black holes are objects with a strong gravitational pull that is so intense
  that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. The gravity of these is so
  strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. They are
  characterized by several physical properties related to their gravity,
  including their mass, spin, and event horizon.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Mass:</span> The mass of a black hole is a
  measure of the amount of matter that it contains, and it determines the
  strength of its gravitational pull. The more massive a black hole is, the
  stronger its gravity will be. Black holes can have masses ranging from a few
  times that of the sun to billions of times that of the sun.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Spin:</span> Black holes can also spin on
  their axis, just like planets and stars. The spin of a black hole can affect
  its gravitational field and the way it interacts with its surroundings. A
  spinning black hole can create a phenomenon known as frame-dragging, in which
  space-time is twisted and dragged around the black hole.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Event Horizon:</span>
  The event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything that enters
  will be trapped by the black hole's gravity and cannot escape. It is the
  surface of the black hole beyond which the escape velocity is greater than the
  speed of light, making it impossible for anything to escape. The size of the
  event horizon is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, with
  more massive black holes having larger event horizons.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Singularity:</span> At the center of a
  black hole is a point called the singularity, where the gravitational pull is
  infinitely strong and space-time is infinitely curved. It is a point of
  infinite density and zero volume, where the laws of physics as we know them
  break down.
  <br />
  <br />
  In summary, black holes are characterized by their mass, spin, event horizon,
  and singularity. These physical properties are a result of the intense
  gravitational pull of the black hole and play an important role in determining
  its behavior and interactions with the surrounding environment.

<h3 class="topics_title">Neutron Stars</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects, with a typical mass similar to
  that of the Sun but a radius of only about 10 kilometers. As a result of this
  extreme density, neutron stars have several unique gravitational physical
  characteristics:
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Strong gravitational pull:</span> Due to
  their high density and compactness, neutron stars have an incredibly strong
  gravitational pull. Objects on the surface of a neutron star experience a
  gravitational acceleration more than a billion times stronger than that on
  Earth.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. High escape velocity:</span> The escape
  velocity from the surface of a neutron star is very high, typically around 0.4
  times the speed of light. This means that any object that gets too close to a
  neutron star will be pulled in by its strong gravitational field and will
  require a large amount of energy to escape.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Gravitational redshift:</span> The intense
  gravitational pull of a neutron star causes a phenomenon known as
  gravitational redshift, where light emitted from the surface of the star is
  shifted to longer, redder wavelengths as it climbs out of the gravitational
  well.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Strong frame-dragging effect:</span> Neutron
  stars have a strong frame-dragging effect, also known as the Lense-Thirring
  effect, where their rotation causes the surrounding spacetime to twist and
  drag, affecting the motion of nearby objects.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Time dilation:</span> The intense
  gravitational field of a neutron star causes time dilation, where time appears
  to pass more slowly in the presence of the star than it does in a region of
  weaker gravity.
  <br />
  <br />
  These gravitational physical characteristics of neutron stars have important
  implications for astrophysics, as they can be used to study the behavior of
  matter under extreme conditions and the properties of spacetime in the
  presence of strong gravitational fields.

<h3 class="topics_title">Quarcks Stars</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  Quark stars are hypothetical stars composed of quarks, the elementary
  particles that make up protons and neutrons. It is a star whose existence is
  not confirmed but which would form after the gravitational collapse of stars
  massive enough to disintegrate neutrons into quarks, giving rise to a sphere
  with a diameter of just 1 km but a density of one trillion kg per cubic meter.
  <br />
  <br />
  Therefore, quark stars would be the intermediate point between a neutron star
  and a black hole. They would be just the step prior to the formation of this
  space-time singularity where matter itself breaks and a black hole emerges.

<h3 class="topics_title">White Dwarfs</h3>
<p class="paragraph_text">
  White dwarfs are the end-stage of evolution for most stars that are not
  massive enough to form a neutron star or a black hole. They are incredibly
  dense objects, with a typical mass similar to that of the Sun, but a radius
  similar to that of the Earth. As a result of their high density, white dwarfs
  have several unique gravitational physical characteristics:
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Strong gravitational pull:</span> White
  dwarfs have a strong gravitational pull, which is much stronger than that of
  the Sun. Objects on the surface of a white dwarf experience a gravitational
  acceleration about 100,000 times stronger than that on Earth.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Low escape velocity:</span> The escape
  velocity from the surface of a white dwarf is relatively low compared to that
  of a neutron star or a black hole, typically around 1-2% of the speed of
  light. This means that any object that gets too close to a white dwarf will be
  pulled in by its gravitational field but will require less energy to escape
  compared to a more massive object.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Gravitational redshift:</span> White
  dwarfs exhibit a small amount of gravitational redshift, where light emitted
  from the surface of the star is shifted to longer, redder wavelengths as it
  climbs out of the gravitational well.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Time dilation:</span> The intense
  gravitational field of a white dwarf causes a small amount of time dilation,
  where time appears to pass more slowly in the presence of the star than it
  does in a region of weaker gravity. These gravitational physical
  characteristics of white dwarfs have important implications for astrophysics,
  as they can be used to study the properties of matter under extreme conditions
  and the behavior of gravity in the presence of high densities.
