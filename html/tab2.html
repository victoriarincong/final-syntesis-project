<h3 class="topics_title">Gravity</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its
  center. The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun.
  <br />
  <br />
  Why do you land on the ground when you jump up instead of floating off into
  space? Why do things fall down when you throw them or drop them? The answer is
  gravity: an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's
  gravity is what keeps you on the ground and what makes things fall.
  <br />

  <br />
  Anything that has mass also has gravity. Objects with more mass have more
  gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to
  each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is.
  <br />
  <br />
  Earth's gravity comes from all its mass. All its mass makes a combined
  gravitational pull on all the mass in your body. That's what gives you weight.
  And if you were on a planet with less mass than Earth, you would weigh less
  than you do here.

<h3 class="topics_title">Hawking Radiation</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  Hawking radiation describes hypothetical particles formed by a black hole's
  boundary. This radiation implies black holes have temperatures that are
  inversely proportional to their mass.
  <br />
  <br />
  Putting it another way, the smaller a black hole is, the hotter it should
  glow.
  <br />
  <br />
  Although it has never been directly observed, Hawking radiation is a
  prediction supported by combined models of general relativity and quantum
  mechanics. It is named after the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking, who, in
  1974, published a paper titled Black hole explosions? arguing for their
  existence.
  <br />
  <br />
  If shown to be factual, Hawking radiation would mean black holes can emit
  energy and therefore shrink in size, with the tiniest of these insanely dense
  objects exploding rapidly in a puff of heat (and the largest slowly
  evaporating over trillions of years in a cold breeze). $$ T_H = \frac{\hbar
  c^3}{8\pi G k_B M} $$

<h3 class="topics_title">Blackhole Evaporation</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  Stephen Hawking discovered in 1974, black holes eventually evaporate,his
  theory on the “Hawking Radiation'' details how blackholes evaporate.
  <br />
  <br />
  As a black hole evaporates, it slowly shrinks and, as it loses mass, the rate
  of particles escaping also increases until all the remaining energy escapes at
  once. In the final tenth of a second of a black hole's life, “you will have a
  huge flash of light and energy.”
