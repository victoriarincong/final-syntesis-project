<h3 class="topics_title">LIGO and Virgo Collaborations</h3>
<p class="paragraph_text">
  The international LIGO/VIRGO collaboration, consisting of the two detectors
  LIGO in the United States and Virgo in Europe,It is organized around three
  general areas of research: analysis of LIGO data searching for gravitational
  waves from astrophysical sources, detector operations and characterization,
  and development of future large-scale gravitational-wave detectors.

<h3 class="topics_title">Einstein's Gravitational Waves</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  The existence of gravitational waves has been known since the publication of
  Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1916. Einstein predicted that when
  two bodies orbit each other, ripples are produced in space, in the same way
  that when a stone is thrown on a water surface, waves are formed.
  <br />
  <br />
  Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in space-time caused by some of the most
  violent and energetic processes in the Universe. Albert Einstein predicted the
  existence of gravitational waves in his general theory of relativity.
  Einstein's mathematics showed that massive accelerating objects (such as
  neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other) would disrupt space-time in
  such a way that 'waves' of undulating space-time would propagate in all
  directions away from the source.

<h4 class="subtopics_subtitles">Types of Gravitational Waves</h4>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuous gravitational waves:</span>
  produced by a single massive rotating object such as a neutron star.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"
    >Compact binary inspiraling gravitational waves:</span
  >
  produced by orbiting pairs of massive and dense ("compact") objects such as
  white dwarf stars, black holes and neutron stars.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stochastic gravitational waves:</span> These
  will be the smallest and most difficult gravitational waves to detect, but it
  is possible that at least part of this stochastic signal originates from the
  Big Bang.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gravitational wave bursts:</span> search for
  'gravitational wave bursts' is really a search for the unexpected, both
  because LIGO has yet to detect them and because there are still so many
  unknowns that we really don't know what to expect.

<h3 class="topics_title">Black Hole Collisions</h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  On September 14, 2015, LIGO detected its first gravitational waves.These were
  signals from the merger of two black holes about 1.3 billion light-years away,
  which carried the name GW150914. Regarding their merger, the scientists
  stipulate that both black holes have a combined mass of "about 200 million
  suns".
  <br />
  <br />
  Since then, LIGO and Virgo have identified two other types of collisions; in
  October 2017, the observatories recorded gravitational waves from the merger
  of two neutron stars for the first time.
